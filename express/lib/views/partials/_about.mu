    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lead"><img src="images/profile.png" alt="">As an <em>Application Architect</em> with Dow Jones I work within the Agile framework to develop modern web applications. I have experience writing both server-side and client-side code with a strong focus on the front-end. I help to ensure that the designer's vision is upheld throughout the development process by transforming their designs into elegant, semantic HTML while maintaining design integrity with pixel-level precision CSS.</p>
